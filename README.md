## What You’ll Learn from Playing

Beyond the laughs, *Spend Bill Gates’ Money* offers some surprising insights:

- **Wealth Is Hard to Grasp**: Even spending $100,000 an hour, it’d take over 114 years to use up $100 billion. That’s wild!
- **Perspective on Costs**: A $2 burger seems cheap until you realize Gates could buy 50 billion of them. It puts everyday prices in a new light.
- **Economic Inequality**: The game highlights how vast the gap is between an average person’s income and a billionaire’s fortune. If you saved $65,000 a year (a decent salary), it’d take 1.5 million years to match Gates’ wealth.
- **Decision-Making**: Do you splurge on one massive item or spread the wealth across smaller buys? It’s a lighthearted way to test your budgeting skills.

It’s not a lecture, but it sneaks in some food for thought while you’re having fun.
